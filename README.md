# Backend Challenges boilerplate - package.json

>The **Node Package Manager** (_npm_) is a command-line tool used by developers to share and control modules (or packages) of JavaScript code written for use with `Node.js`.

When starting a new project, `npm` generates a `package.json` file. This file lists the package dependencies for your project. Since npm packages are regularly updated, the package.json file allows you to set specific version numbers for each dependency. This ensures that updates to a package don't break your project.
